## Detection Use Case: Malware Execution

### Scenario Description
A malware binary is dropped and executed on the victim system.

### Objective
Detect execution of unsigned or rare executables.

### Tools Used
- **SIEM**: ELK Stack
- **Log Source**: Sysmon
- **Lab Setup**: Malware sample executed on test Windows host.

Event ID / Data Source Mapping
|Source|	Event ID / Field|	   Description    |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
|Sysmon|	       1	      | Process execution |

### Detection Logic / Query
``` dsl
event.code:"1" AND process.name:"cmd.exe"
```
The above query filters all the processes created with the name cmd.exe. While analysing the fields one by one in Sysmon or Kibana Discover, we can find the details of malware.bat in one of the logs.
